          <h1>Project 1 - Colorizing the Prokudin-Gorskii Photo Collection</h1>
          <p>Filip Malm-Bägén</p>
          <hr />
          <img id="hero" src="sculpture.jpg" alt="" />
          <p>
            In the early 1900s, Prokudin-Gorskii traveled across the Russian
            Empire and took photographs of the people, landscapes, and
            architecture. His photographs were taken in black and white, but he
            used a special camera that took three photographs in quick
            succession, each with a different color filter (red, green, and
            blue). The technology to print color photographs did not exist at
            the time, so Prokudin-Gorskii's photographs were not seen in color
            until the 2000s when they were digitized and the color channels were
            aligned. This project is about colorizing the Prokudin-Gorskii photo
            using the three black and white images, to produce the intended
            color photos whitnessed by the photogorapher himself. Additionaly,
            methods of automaticaly contrasting and adjusting the White Balance
            of the images are implemented.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section id="section2">
          <h2>Method</h2>
          <p>
            The task of colorizing the Prokudin-Gorskii photo collection was not
            a trivial one. The process required careful alignment of the three
            color channels, all of which used an image pyramid to calculate the
            best alignment. Thereafter, the images were adjusted for automatic
            White Balance and contrast.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section id="section2.1">
          <h3>Segmentation</h3>
          <p>
            The image was divided into three parts, each representing a color
            channel. The blue channel was treated as the base image, and the
            green and red channels are aligned to the blue channel.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section id="section2.2">
          <h3>Normalized Cross Correlation (NCC)</h3>
          <p>
            In order to align the green and red channels to the blue channel,
            the normalized cross-correlation (NCC) was used as a scoring index
            for each alignment. A search window of [-15, 15] pixels were used to
            find the best alignment in the x and y directions. At each new
            position, the NCC was calculated and compared to the best score. The
            position with the highest similarity score was considered the best
            alignment.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section id="section2.3">
          <h3>Image Pyramid</h3>
          <p>
            Given the large size of the images, computing Normalized
            Cross-Correlation (NCC) for every possible pixel position directly
            was impractical. To manage this, an image pyramid approach was used
            to downsample the images, reducing their size by factors of 3, 9,
            and 27. The pyramid_scaledown function was employed to create these
            smaller image versions, smoothing and downsampling them. At each
            pyramid level, alignment was initialized with the coarsest image and
            progressively refined as the images were scaled to higher
            resolutions. NCC was calculated on centered images to avoid edge
            effects, and the best alignment at each level guided the search for
            finer adjustments. This method efficiently handles large
            displacements and achieves accurate alignment by leveraging
            progressively smaller images and refining the results iteratively.

        <section id="section2.4">
          <h3>Sobel Filter</h3>
          <p>
            For the image "emir", the color channels does not match in their
            brigtness values, which made it difficult to align the channels. To
            solve this, an edge detection algorithm using a sobel filter was
            used to enhance the edges of the image. These edge-images where send
            through the same align function in order to stich the channels
            togheter.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section id="section2.5">
          <h3>Contrast</h3>
          <p>
            The auto-contrast algorithm enhances image contrast by
            redistributing pixel intensities across the full range. It
            calculates the frequency of each intensity level, computes a
            cumulative distribution function (CDF), and normalizes it. This
            normalized CDF was used to remap the pixel intensities, stretching
            the contrast and improving the image's overall appearance.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section id="section2.6">
          <h3>White Balance</h3>
          <p>
            The auto-white balance algorithm adjusts the colors of an image to
            correct color casts. It computes the average color of the image and
            then scales each color channel to a target gray point. This
            adjustment helps ensure that the image colors appear more neutral.
            Finally, the algorithm clips the values to ensure they stay within
            the valid range, resulting in a balanced image with corrected
            colors.

          <h2>Challenges</h2>
          <p>
            Regarding the NCC, it was discovered early that a peeking window of
            half the size of the image was sufficient to find the best
            alignment. If the whole image was used, the process would take too
            long to complete and the result would be worse due to the
            unpredicible borders of each color channel disturbing the alignment.

          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          <p>
            As seen on the result above, the colorization of the
            Prokudin-Gorskii photo collection was a success. The images were
            aligned and colorized using the three black and white images. The
            images were also adjusted for automatic contrast and white balance,
            resulting in improved image quality in some cases.
          </p>
          <p>
            The contrast increased a lot for the onion church and the melons,
            while the contrast for the sculpture was not as significant. The
            automatic white balance improved the images slightly, especily for
            the sculpture and the melons. The algortihms seems to darken the
            harvesters image, which was not the intended result. For the
            selection of the images, the combination of contrast and white
            balance appears to worsen every image, expect for the sculpture. The
            onion church especily got its details sharpened and the combination
            made the image appear overly processes. The rest of the images can
            be seen HERE.
          </p>
          <p>
            If i were to continue working on this project, I would try to
            improve the contrast and white balance algorithms to better suit the
            images. I would also like to automaticaly cut the borders of the
            images, as they create an odd effect when the images are stiched at
            the margins.
          </p>
          <p>
            The project demonstrates the power of image processing techniques
            and how an idea from the early 1900s can be brought to life using
            modern technology.
