          <h1>Project 1 - Colorizing the Prokudin-Gorskii Photo Collection</h1>
          <p>Filip Malm-Bägén</p>
          <hr />
          <img id="hero" src="sculpture.jpg" alt="" />
          <p>
            In the early 1900s, Prokudin-Gorskii traveled across the Russian
            Empire and took photographs of the people, landscapes, and
            architecture. His pictures were taken in black-and-white, but he
            used a special camera that took three photographs in quick
            succession, each with a different color filter (red, green blue).
            The technology to print color photographs did not exist at the time,
            so Prokudin-Gorskii's photographs were not seen in color until the
            2000s when they were digitized and the color channels were aligned.
            This project is about colorizing the Prokudin-Gorskii photo using
            the three black and white images, to produce the intended color
            photos witnessed by the photographer himself. Additionally, methods
            of automatically contrasting and adjusting the white balance of the
            images are implemented.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section id="section2">
          <h2>Method</h2>
          <p>
            The task of colorizing the Prokudin-Gorskii photo collection was not
            a trivial one. The process required careful alignment of the three
            color channels, all of which used an image pyramid to calculate the
            best alignment. Thereafter, the images were adjusted for automatic
            white balance and contrast.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section id="section2.1">
          <h3>Segmentation</h3>
          <p>
            The image was divided into three parts, each representing a color
            channel. The blue channel was treated as the base image, and the
            green and red channels were aligned to the blue channel.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section id="section2.2">
          <h3>Normalized Cross Correlation (NCC)</h3>
          <p>
            In order to align the green and red channels to the blue channel,
            the Normalized Cross-Correlation (NCC) was used as a scoring index
            for each alignment. A search window of [-15, 15] pixels was used to
            find the best alignment in the x and y directions. At each new
            position, the NCC was calculated and compared to the best score. The
            position with the highest similarity score was considered the best
            alignment.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section id="section2.3">
          <h3>Image Pyramid</h3>
          <p>
            Given the large size of the images, computing NCC for every possible
            pixel position directly was impractical. To manage this, an image
            pyramid approach was used to downsample the images, reducing their
            size by a factor of 3. The pyramid_scaledown function was used to
            create the smaller image versions, smoothing and downsampling them.
            At each pyramid level, alignment was initialized with the coarsest
            image and progressively refined as the images were scaled to higher
            resolutions. NCC was calculated on centered images to avoid edge
            effects, and the best alignment at each level guided the search for
            finer adjustments. This method efficiently handles large
            displacements and achieves accurate alignment by leveraging
            progressively smaller images and refining the results iteratively.

        <section id="section2.4">
          <h3>Sobel Filter</h3>
          <p>
            For the image "emir.tif", the color channels do not match their
            brightness values, which made it difficult to align the channels. To
            solve this, an edge detection algorithm using a Sobel filter was
            used to enhance the edges of the image. These edge images were sent
            through the same align function in order to stitch the channels
            together.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section id="section2.5">
          <h3>Contrast</h3>
          <p>
            The auto-contrast algorithm enhances image contrast by
            redistributing pixel intensities across the full range. It
            calculates the frequency of each intensity level, computes a
            cumulative distribution function (CDF), and normalizes it. This
            normalized CDF was used to remap the pixel intensities, stretching
            the contrast and improving the image's overall appearance.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section id="section2.6">
          <h3>White Balance</h3>
          <p>
            The auto-white balance algorithm adjusts the colors of an image to
            correct color casts. It computes the average color of the image and
            then scales each color channel to a target gray point. This
            adjustment helps ensure that the image colors appear more neutral.
            Finally, the algorithm clips the values to ensure they stay within
            the valid range, resulting in a balanced image with corrected
            colors.

          <h2>Challenges</h2>
          <p>
            Regarding the NCC, it was discovered early that a peeking window of
            half the size of the image was sufficient to find the best
            alignment. If the whole image was used, the process would take too
            long to complete and the result would be worse due to the
            unpredictable borders of each color channel disturbing the
            alignment.
          </p>

          <p>
            The image "emir.tif" was particularly challenging due to the
            mismatch of the color channels. The edge detection algorithm using a
            Sobel filter was used to enhance the edges of the image, which
            improved the alignment of the channels.
          </p>

          <p>
            The image pyramid algorithm was also challenging to implement. When
            running the algorithm without the image pyramid, the process takes
            around 6.2 minutes to complete and the result is worse than when
            using the image pyramid. With the image pyramid, the process takes
            around 8 seconds to complete on the same machine and the result is
            significantly better. That is about 50x faster. I belive the poor
            result is because the image is too large and the NCC algorithm is
            not able to find the best alignment efficiently. The [15, 15] search
            window gives no real change on the large image. Therefore the
            downscale of the image is necessary to let the window find its
            approximate alignment at each layer.

            In addition to the colorization of the Prokudin-Gorskii photo

          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          <p>
            As seen in the result above, the colorization of the
            Prokudin-Gorskii photo collection was a success. The images were
            aligned and colorized using the three black and white images. The
            images were also adjusted for automatic contrast and white balance,
            resulting in improved image quality in some cases.
          </p>
          <p>
            The contrast increased a lot for the onion church and the melons,
            while the contrast for the sculpture was not as significant. The
            automatic white balance improved the images slightly, especially for
            the sculpture and the melons. The algorithms seem to darken the
            harvesters' image, which was not the intended result. For the
            selection of the images, the combination of contrast and white
            balance appears to worsen every image, except for the sculpture. The
            onion church especially got its details sharpened and the
            combination made the image appear overly processed. The rest of the
            images can be seen

              href="https://github.com/filipbagen/cs-180/tree/main/p1-prokudin-colorization/result"

          <p>
            If I were to continue working on this project, I would try to
            improve the contrast and white balance algorithms to better suit the
            images. The problem probably arose due to the high saturated borders
            which gave the image an imbalance in colors. Therefore I would start
            by constructing an algorithm that can automatically cut the borders
            of the images, as they create an odd effect when the images are
            stitched at the margins.
          </p>
          <p>
            The project demonstrates the power of image processing techniques
            and how an idea from the early 1900s can be brought to life using
            modern technology.
